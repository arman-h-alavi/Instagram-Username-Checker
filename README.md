# Instagram-Username-Checker
## Telegram bot to check if the given Instagram usernames are available or banned
This program is a Telegram bot that can be added to groups, with only admins having access to the bot's functions. The aim of the bot is to receive Instagram usernames and check whether they are active, non-existent, or banned. The usernames can be provided as a Telegram text message or in a 'username.txt' file containing one or multiple usernames.
